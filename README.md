## About the project

This project consists of building an application which allows the user to search for a given city, resulting in a five day weather forecast being shown in the form of cards. The cards contain an icon indicating the type of weather, the current UV index rating, temperature, wind and humidity levels.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Web APIs used

- [Open Weather One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api)

### User Flow

- AS a user
- I want to type a city
- SO that a five day forecast is generated
- IF I then search for another city
- THEN the current city is saved in a list below

## Plans For Improvement

- Add loading modals to indicate that API call is being made
- Add additional CSS properties such as specific colour cards for specific temperatures (hot = red, cold = blue etc)
- Add additional API to link to live public camera in searched city
